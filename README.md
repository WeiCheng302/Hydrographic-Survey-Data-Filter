# Hydrographic-Survey-Data-Filter
This program is used to help the selection of Hydrographic Survey datas. 
Usually, there are many observations on one GPS position.
In this program, we tried only get one point depth value on one GPS position.
First, we kick out the big errors. Then we go into data selection part. 
The chosen value would locate at the the value whose GPS position changes from one to another.
